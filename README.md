==========

These are the source files for [http://www.openfl.org](http://www.openfl.org). The site is built using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), which allows the website to be built as a combination of HTML and Markdown source files, and compiled into the final output, which is static.

The blog posts are hosted under `_posts`, and the data for the showcase is set under `_data/showcase.yaml`

Thanks for using OpenFL!
