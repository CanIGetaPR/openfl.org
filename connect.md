# Connect

We love meeting new people and developing together!

You can find the community on the [OpenFL forums](http://community.openfl.org), as well as [Slack chat](http://openfl.slack.com) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Open_FL).

Need an invite to Slack? Trying sending a PM to @Open_FL, or @singmajesty on the forums.
