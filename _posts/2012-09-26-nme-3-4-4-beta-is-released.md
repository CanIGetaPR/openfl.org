We are pleased to announce the release of NME 3.4.4 Beta.

This morning, Research In Motion released new developer SDKs and a new preview of BlackBerry 10 at the BlackBerry Jam Americas event.

One week ago, a new version of Xcode went public, coinciding with the newest version of iOS.

NME 3.4.4 adds full support for BlackBerry 10. We have also fixed issues that appeared when upgrading to Xcode 4.5.

There are also changes that help improve compatibility with Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 controllers, that help expose low-level GL functionality from Haxe, and also the stability and quality of NME overall.

You can <a href="http://www.haxenme.org/download">download the installer</a> for Windows, Mac or Linux.
