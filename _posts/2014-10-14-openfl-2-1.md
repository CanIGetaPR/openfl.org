title: OpenFL 2.1

It's here! The next version of OpenFL is now final. Thank you to all of our contributors, testers and [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/openfl) supporters.

We are on an exciting road together as we move toward one combined codebase, you can read more about the new Lime library and the combined codebase in the [OpenFL 2.1 Beta](http://www.openfl.org/blog/2014/10/04/openfl-2-1-beta/) or the [summer development update](http://www.openfl.org/blog/2014/07/29/summer-update/). For stability, we are not switching to a new codebase for native, but have instead made bug fix improvements, and have integrated the ability to test the new (not yet complete) "next" codebase using -Dnext or -Dopenfl-next.

## How to Install

If you already have OpenFL, you should be able to upgrade like this:

    lime upgrade openfl

If you are installing for the first time, you can use:

    haxelib install lime
    haxelib run lime setup
    lime install openfl

If you have trouble with downloading any packages over haxelib, you can also download install Lime and OpenFL manually:
