Hello everyone! Welcome.

I want to take a moment to introduce some important people in the Haxe and NME communities. These are people who have made this whole project possible.

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ncannasse" target="_blank">Nicolas Cannasse</a> is the creator of MTASC, Neko and Haxe. You can see more about the games that he and the rest of the team at Motion-Twin have been developing <a href="http://motion-twin.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/gamehaxe" target="_blank">Hugh Sanderson</a> developed C++ as a target for Haxe (HXCPP) and created NME. He also has a game library called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gm2d/" target="_blank">GM2D</a> which includes a lot of great resources for development.

My name is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/singmajesty" target="_blank">Joshua Granick</a>. I added the webOS target to NME a little over a year ago and have been helping improve the project since.

<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/grumpytoad" target="_blank">Niel Drummond</a> is the creator of Jeash, which started as a port of NME to Javascript. Since then, Jeash has grown as an exciting cross-browser library. This week, Jeash has been added as a new supported target for NME.

Please join me in celebrating Nicolas, Hugh, Niel and all the others that have made Haxe and NME possible. I am very excited for what the future may hold!
