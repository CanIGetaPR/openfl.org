Hello everyone! Welcome.

I want to take a moment to introduce some important people in the Haxe and NME communities. These are people who have made this whole project possible.

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;#!&#47;ncannasse" target="_blank">Nicolas Cannasse<&#47;a> is the creator of MTASC, Neko and Haxe. You can see more about the games that he and the rest of the team at Motion-Twin have been developing <a href="http:&#47;&#47;motion-twin.com&#47;" target="_blank">here<&#47;a>!

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;#!&#47;gamehaxe" target="_blank">Hugh Sanderson<&#47;a> developed C++ as a target for Haxe (HXCPP) and created NME. He also has a game library called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;gm2d&#47;" target="_blank">GM2D<&#47;a> which includes a lot of great resources for development.

My name is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;#!&#47;singmajesty" target="_blank">Joshua Granick<&#47;a>. I added the webOS target to NME a little over a year ago and have been helping improve the project since.

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;#!&#47;grumpytoad" target="_blank">Niel Drummond<&#47;a> is the creator of Jeash, which started as a port of NME to Javascript. Since then, Jeash has grown as an exciting cross-browser library. This week, Jeash has been added as a new supported target for NME.

Please join me in celebrating Nicolas, Hugh, Niel and all the others that have made Haxe and NME possible. I am very excited for what the future may hold!
