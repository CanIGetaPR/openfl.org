It has only been a day, but we want to share a new beta release with you!

This release brings us closer to a final release, resolving the issues that have been discovered since the beta:
<ul>
	<li>Small fixes for `<template />` nodes in NMML</li>
	<li>Small fixes for `<haxelib />` and `<include />` nodes for NME extensions</li>
	<li>Integrated a patch that improves Tilesheet.drawTiles compatibility in Flash</li>
	<li>Small improvements to `<asset />` nodes in NMML</li>
	<li>Fixed defaults for applications that use a window width and height of 0 (fullscreen)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug which caused the backspace in iOS to remove two characters</li>
	<li>Added support for "FF0000" and "#FF0000" formats as the window background</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where transparent fills would render as 0xFFFFFFFF instead</li>
</ul>
This release also updates the installers, which now include HXCPP 2.08.1 and the SWF library by default.
