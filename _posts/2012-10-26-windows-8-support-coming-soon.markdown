Windows 8 has been officially launched today, and we are moving toward a new version of NME that provides integrated support for the new modern interface and the Windows Store.

Initially, support will be provided using web technologies. In the future, we will continue to&nbsp;explore the possibility of providing native support for the modern interface for ARM and x86 systems. NME will continue to support Win32 as it has done for a long time.

Stay tuned for more updates in the future!
