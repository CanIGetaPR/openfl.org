If you frequent the developer forums, you have probably some changes around here.

What happened to NME? We believe that most developers that were using NME will be even happier using OpenFL. NME still exists as a lower-level library, but most of our development efforts have transitioned into making OpenFL the best choice for cross-platform development.

We have included an "openfl-compatibility" library that helps older NME projects work with OpenFL, or you can take the plunge and change your class imports. Other than that, OpenFL should largely work the same, but better, than NME did.

Thanks for being an incredible part of what has made this journey enjoyable!
