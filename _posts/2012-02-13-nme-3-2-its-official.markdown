NME 3.2 is now live!

Go to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.haxenme.org&#47;developers&#47;get-started">Get Started<&#47;a> page to get your copy for Windows, Mac or Linux. We have rewritten the installers for Windows and Mac since NME 3.1, so we hope that the experience is even better than before.

If you have been following the beta releases, this release includes some low-level improvements, improved handling for different orientations on iOS, as well as a few more fixes.

Here is the list of changes since NME 3.1.1:
<ul>
	<li>Android applications will install to external storage (SD card) by default.<&#47;li>
	<li>Improved support for special directories on all targets.<&#47;li>
