It's been a few weeks in coming, but NME 3.3.1 is finally out. There's nothing major to announce yet, but we've packed a variety of smaller improvements to make NME an even better experience.

Most notable are improvements for Haxe 2.09, the BlackBerry target and some minor issues that affected the iOS and HTML5 targets. There have also been improvements in the accelerometer behavior and in URLLoader.
